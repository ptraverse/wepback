# Webpack with a typo

Ever accidentally typed "wepback" instead of "webpack" ?

Introducing, <b>WEPBACK</b>, the punishment for being sloppy.

From now on, if you do either of these:
```
npm install wepback
```
```
yarn install wepback
```

And then <b>sudo</b> run either incantation (correct, or with typo):
```
sudo wepback
```
```
sudo webpack
```

You will get <b><span style="color: red;">PWNED!</div></b>
